After she matriculated from high school, she and her family relocated from Grahamstown to Cape Town. After relocating to Cape Town, Rachel secured herself some part-time jobs to finance her <a href=#>education</a>. Later, she pursued higher education in events management.</p><h2>What does Mrs Kolisi do for a living?</h2><p class=align-left>Before having children, she was a marketing executive.

I don’t think there is anything more beautiful than when people share something rally difficult that tey went through in an exchange to help others in something they might be going through themselves,” she shared in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a> with social media influencer and motivational speaker, Mpoomy Ledwaba.<p class=align-left>She also went into detail about how she went on a faith journey in 2019 and she had no doubts that the Springboks would win the World Cup.</p>“God will trust you with responsibility but you have to make sure that you prepare for that. I cleared my plate that year and I was like, ‘Okay Lord, I’m 100% prepare for this and you can trust us with this’ because we understood the impact this win would have on South Africa. I just wouldn’t entertain conversations that were not building that vision.”<p></p><h2>Rachel recently went back to school</h2><p class=align-left>At the beginning of the year, Rachel shared the news of <a href=#>becoming a student</a> again.</p><p class=align-left>While she didn’t go into detail about what she will be studying, Rachel shared in the lengthy caption how she has been wanting to study for a long time now but just had not had the opportunity to.</p>“Finally decided to take a dive and do it.
