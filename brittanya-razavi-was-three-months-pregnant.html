She rose to prominence as a reality star on the show Real Chance Of Love, but she also made headlines after being imprisoned for assaulting a woman.</strong></p><p>Despite her prison sentence, which harmed her reputation and celebrity, the reality star has taken everything in stride. Thanks to her supportive husband, who has acted as a sounding board for her.</p><h2><span id=Brittanya_is_incarcerated_for_assault_and_violence>Brittanya is incarcerated for assault and violence</span></h2><p>Brittanya, a brave American model, received a six-month prison sentence in 2010. She had pled guilty to attacking a lady with a “pimp chalice,” as investigators characterized it.</p><p>As a result, the 35-year-old man was charged with both felony assault with a dangerous weapon and misdemeanor violence. Brittanya was arrested at Ventura County Jail two years after the alleged incident occurred in 2008.</p><h2><span id=She_was_sentenced_to_prison_while_three_months_pregnant>She was sentenced to prison while three months pregnant</span></h2><p>Brittanya was sentenced to prison while three months pregnant with her son, Cash, in 2010. However, it wasn’t until around a decade later that the reality star broke the news. Brittanya took to Instagram on <strong>July 27, 2019</strong>, to thank those who had doubted her during her difficult times.</p><p>In the caption, she stated that her recovery story was an inspiration to individuals who did not have any support in their lives. The reality personality said she was three months pregnant at the time of her incarceration.</p><p><strong>“I’m 3 months pregnant with some Chola brows hating life haha,” she explained in the post</strong></p><p><strong>“Here I am releasing the rawest photo of myself with you guys to reveal everything about myself to you and show you all that there is always hope!” she stated.</strong></p><p>Even when Brittanya is at her lowest, her husband remains faithful. Brittanya is married to Marcello Razavi, also known as Moe Drama or Lucky Razavi, and the couple has been married for about a decade.</p><p>It’s no wonder that her hubby has remained by her side through every up and down in her life. He was present when she rose to fame, and he was still present when she was imprisoned.</p><p>In a nutshell, Marcello, who began with a degree in fashion design, was a loving companion in every stage of life, so much so that he tattooed her name on his face while she was in jail.</p><p>In a special anniversary Instagram post on <strong>January 23, 2020,</strong> the reality star emphasized her husband’s commitment.</p><h2><span id=Brittanya_Razavi_is_a_mother_of_three_boys>Brittanya Razavi is a mother of three boys</span></h2><p>As of 2021, Brittanya is the mother of three boys. Her sons with Moe Drama are Cash and Legend, while Romeo is from a previous relationship. Brittanya Razavi is open about sharing photos of her children on social media and claims that they are her universe.</p><p>Cash was her only company in jail (before his birth), she stated in a March 2020 report, and she never felt alone with him. Her closest buddy was Cash, but she also adored her younger son. Legend, according to Brittanya, is her male twin. Legend, she claimed, was a natural-born hustler capable of producing anything despite rejection.</p><p>Similarly, she posted on<strong> January 8, 2020,</strong> that her oldest child [from a previous relationship] was 18 years old. “Yes, I have three boys, one of them is 18 years old, therefore all of his friends are 18 and jacking off to my stuff,” she wrote.</p><p>Razavi appears to have been able to turn her life around thanks to the continual love and support of her children and marriage. She is now the founder and CEO of 187 Inc, a thriving and profitable custom-made streetwear company. She and her husband own the business together.</p><p><strong>Also, Read <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Eniko Hart And Her Parents, Especially Her Mother, Are Very Close</a></strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Raul Yzaguirre</a></h3>Raul Yzaguirre estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
