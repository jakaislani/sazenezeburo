As a child, he never had these limitations imposed on him, and he never expected things to be easy for him; instead, he worked hard for them. So, even though Anakin had more power than Luke, it didn't matter.<h2>Are Sith stronger than Jedi?</h2>The Sith have much more immediate power than the Jedi, as they can quickly control the Force and bend its power to their will.
