family, measurements</h1><div id=sub-header>June 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>When you see Chip Brewster, Rob Haswell, Cassandra McShepard and Angelica Duria recount the FOX6&nbsp;</span><span>Real Milwaukee</span><span>&nbsp;lifestyle , the other person who can never go away is journalist and anchor Nicole Koglin.&nbsp;She began to rise to prominence in the network since September 2004, when she began working on the network’s morning show.&nbsp;</span><span>Wake up.&nbsp;</span><span>What turned out to be a surprise to many was when they learned that despite Nicole working in the mornings, she wasn’t really a morning person.&nbsp;It’s weird!&nbsp;Check out some other things you’ve probably never seen about the veteran TV presenter and journalist below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography – Who is Nicole Koglin?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The television personality came through the union of his parents who resided in the village of Menomonee Falls, which is more specifically a town.&nbsp;Nicole Koglin was born there many years ago and spent much of her youth there.&nbsp;There is no verified record of her parents’ names and whether or not she had any siblings, however, from what we have gathered and drawn an inference, her childhood was pleasant and au worst normal.</span></p><p><span>After high school, the FOX6 hometown girl earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&nbsp;In college, Nicole Koglin worked as a waitress and bartender.&nbsp;Clients she has attended sometimes strike up a conversation with her, asking her what she was investigating, her backup plan, and whether she would venture into sales.&nbsp;Nicole never really had a back-up plan, but within four years she was through with Madison, ready to face the life that lay ahead.</span></p><p><span>Having spent a lot of time in and around her hometown, Koglin wanted to move much farther from Wisconsin to experience life elsewhere.&nbsp;Realizing this desire, she traveled to Idaho Falls, Idaho, four hours east of Boise, where she landed a job as a television reporter.&nbsp;Nicole did this for two years before moving to Springfield, Missouri, where she held a similar position.</span></p><p><span>Over time, Nicole Koglin began to feel like Wisconsin was looking great and needed to get in order to go home.&nbsp;Upon arrival, she signed up for a morning show –&nbsp;</span><span>Awake</span><span>&nbsp;{September 2004} where she covered morning traffic on FOX6.&nbsp;She learned by trial and error and was soon good enough to be promoted.&nbsp;Nicole’s promotion was the weekend anchor for WakeUP.&nbsp;On the show, she covered local news, lifestyle and even teased her co-hosts: Jessob Reisbeck, Rob Haswell, Kim Murphy and Angelica Duria.&nbsp;Next came her elevation to handle the station’s fashion show called Real Milwaukee with co-hosts Chip Brewster, Rob Haswell, Cassandra McShepard and Angelica Duria.</span></p><p><span>Clearly, Nicole Koglin’s career has been rising steadily and smoothly;&nbsp;As a traffic reporter, she became a co-host of FOX6’s Lifestyle.&nbsp;Where she is now might be many people’s dream, but for her, it is just one step as she is on her way to achieving more career milestones.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – husband, child</span></strong></h2><p><span>Outside of the hustle and bustle of her TV work, Nicole Koglin enjoys a peaceful married life with Jason Kutter;&nbsp;her long-term boyfriend who also works at FOX6.&nbsp;Before making an eternal vow, they dated for six years and got married in October 2010. Since their marriage, they have given birth to two daughters: Emma and Paige.&nbsp;Paige was born on October 27, 2015.</span></p><p><span>Nicole Koglin is an animal lover.&nbsp;While working in Missouri, she rescued a feline (cat) she named Mo, which she brought to Wisconsin when she moved.&nbsp;In fact, Mo came into her life before she met her boyfriend and now her husband.&nbsp;She revealed she was a ‘crazy closet cat lady’ during an interview when asked about a cat stroller she had purchased.&nbsp;Nicole revealed that they recently got an Australian Shepherd dog and whenever they went for a walk with him, Mo always got jealous.&nbsp;So she ordered it for the stroller.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>The journalist and presenter is a pretty face to look like his good looks may have, in many ways, made his career in the media easier, given that TV presenters are expected to be good looking in addition to being good at their jobs.&nbsp;However, his body measurements are not disclosed publicly.&nbsp;When they are, we will let you know.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMp6Ccp5yaeqy7xqWgp2WSnryovsCpn7JlmKrAo63NnWSfmZ2eubp5zJ6YrK2imrqmutOsZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./larry-gelbart.html>&#171;&nbsp;Larry Gelbart</a>
